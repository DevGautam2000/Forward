<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was born from a need for a software to track daily progress and time invested into work in general and solving DSA in specefic. In the hunt for a suitable application to fulfil our needs, we ended up building our own project. Forward keeps track of the time spent daily towards any activity and generates a graph based on collected data over time. It has a sign in feature and supports multiple concurrent users but is restricted to one device per user.

## Tech Stack
